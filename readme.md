# Appmonsta + Google Analytics / Adwords

This community connector connects your Google Adwords data (through Google Analytics) to extend more information into ad placement throug the Google Display Network in mobile apps.

If you're using GDN to automatically or manually place ads, the only data you're able to see about a mobile app is the ID of the app. For example:

Placement ID: `mobileapp::1-1234567890`
App ID: `1234567890`

By cross referencing this data with Appmonsta, you're able to understand more deeply what are the types of apps, how popular they are, and if they fit your target audience.
